I had an interaction with a my friend last Saturday where I was trying to convince
her to go out to eat with me but also make her choose a place because I didn't want 
to choose where to go. The context was me and two of my close friends, Daisy and 
Ron, had joined me for my tattoo appointment as emotional support. Ron and I had 
met up before Daisy joined us, and we ate Zupas before meeting up with her. We 
unintentionally showed up to the appointment an hour early and had to wait on the
couches of the waiting area. Ron and Daisy immediately got on their phones, 
indicating that they were fine to wait right there, however I didn't really feel 
like spending the whole hour just sitting on the couches. Ron had her headphones 
in so she wasn't receptive to conversation at the time. So, I turned to Daisy 
and asked her, "Hey, would you be down to go to an antique shop?" 
She replied, "Yeah, sure." 
Continueing the conversation, I said, "Maybe we could also go to a food place or 
something. Have you eaten anything today?" 
She responded, "I ate a bag of Cheez-Its." 
"That doesn't count."
"Okay," she said with a laugh, "Yeah maybe. But haven't you and Ron already eaten?"
"Yeah, but we could still go somewhere."
This is honestly an approximation of how the conversation went, I don't remember it 
word for word. We ended up going to the antique shop but not to a resturaunt until 
after the appointment.The antique shop was expensive and small, so were there and 
back in around 20-30 minutes, and we still had to sit on the couch for another 
little while before the artist was ready for me. What I should've done was 
communicated to her that I was feeling antsy and nervous about the appointment, 
and I wanted to go to a resturaunt because I didn't want to sit still, not because 
I was concerned about her eating habits. Even just adding something along the lines
of, "I just don't wanna sit still right now." would have better communicated my 
needs and made it more likely to fully achieve my goal.
