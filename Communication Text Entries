Hi my name is Cossette and this is me. 

I am a huge weeb, as shown by my posters... and stickers.. 
and t-shirts... and more stickers... and baby manga collection... and more stickers

if you recognize any of these characters, please be my friend.

My current shows /games are Stardew Valley, Pokemon TCG, Chainsaw Man,
and Attack on Titan. 

I also do cosplay and dnd. Guess which one is more expensive? ... 
Ready for the answer? It depends on how much effort and money you want to put in,
but for me, cosplay. easily. 

I'm currently living in Saratoga Springs, but between school and work,
I spend a lot of time in Orem. 

I am nocturnal so this evening class is prime awake time for me, but I also
might be late occasionally because I come here straight from work. 

So, that's me in a nutshell. i look forward from learning from yall this semester!!
